                <p>Planning a trip for Disney World may have been the 
                    most difficult part of the trip itself. My wife and 
                    I planned for almost a year for what parks we would 
                    visit and where we would eat. The process was a little
                    more grueling than it should have been.

                </p>
                
                <p>Without ever visiting the park you have to pick where
                    you are going to eat and what rides you wanna ride at 
                    very specific times. You have to plan this and submit 
                    it months in advance to reserve your placement or take
                    the risk of not being able to enjoy all the experiences 
                    the parks have to offer. For about 300,000&cent; I thought
                    it would have been easier to plan.

                alt="roadtrip">
                <p>This is just a little tidbit of my opinions of how someone 
                    should plan to travel. My wife and I drove from St. Louis to
                    Orlando. The trip by mapquest should have taken just a little 
                    under 18 hours. But when you have multiple people, one being a
                    2 year old, there is no way to run it through with no stops in 
                    between. I made the drive overnight myself, with about 5-6 stops
                    accounting for 19-20 hours of travel. That being said getting 
                    there was not as bad as you think, even with the few meltdowns from
                    my daughter who was to be honest, an angel for the long distance 
                    we traveled. 

                </p>


                
                <p>Coming back home after a week long trip on the other hand, was 
                    just awful. I, myself was just so tired and a little crabby during
                    the car ride. My daughter realizing we were leaving "The Happiest
                    Place on Earth" was getting upset a lot more cause she wanted to
                    be out of her car seat and back at the parks. And my wife was tired 
                    as well from the long nights and early days so we could get as much
                    as we could out of our trip. I couldn't make the whole drive back home 
                    by myself for fear of falling asleep. I will never make the drive to 
                    Disney again. That isn't to say we won't be going back, but I think
                    a flight will definitely be in our future.

                <p>Now the part that everyone actually cares about. Disney World!!! Did
                    we like it, how was it, were the rides fun, ect. Well, all in all, I 
                    would give the trip 8 out of 10. My daughter had so many instances of 
                    just being in awe, that it made the trip worth it on it's own. She 
                    showed so much emotion meeting Elsa(Frozen) in person. You could see how 
                    nervous, and excited she was all at the same time. It was amazing to see
                    a little girl get so excited to meet one of her favorite princesses.
                    And that was just one of the many events that we enjoyed. I would say 
                    that the events and her reactions were priceless on their own. Without
                    spoiling anything for anyone else the only reason Disney only had an 8
                    was due to the massive crowds and eternal wait times if you didn't have 
                    a fast pass for the rides you were wanting to enjoy.
